In my long life, there are two things I would never do. <br/>
The firsty thing is to never feel self-pity. <br/>
Life is always accompanied by terrible blows, serious setbacks, unfair encounters, and so on. <br/>
I'm never surprised by humanity.<br/><br/>
-- Charlie Thomas Munger (1924 - 2023).<br/>

在我漫长的一生中，有两件事我绝不会做。<br/>
第一件事就是：永远不要自怜。<br/>
人生总会伴随着可怕的打击、严重的挫折、不公平的遭遇等等。<br/>
我永远不会因为人性而感到意外。<br/>
